  biography:
    "Hello! I'm Jason Woo, an aspiring web developer based in KL.With a background in civil engineering, I bring with me a solid foundation in critical thinking, technical analysis, and logic, skills that are likely transferable to the world of coding. My journey into coding was fueled by a desire for greater fulfillment and curiosity for learning new things. I'm enthusiastic about crafting visually appealing and functional websites that leave a lasting impression. I'm particularly interested in understanding the technologies we use every day, such as websites, apps, and algorithms. I look forward to being involved in projects where I can continue learning and growing as a developer along the way. A job opportunity in web development would be greatly appreciated, as this would mark my transition from civil engineering to my first role in the field. Let's connect and bring your digital vision to life!",
